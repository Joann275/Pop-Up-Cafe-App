# Pop-Up-Cafe-App
Completed a mini-project which was a CLI application built in Python.
It was based around an application needed for a pop-up cafe so they could create orders for customers. 
It stored data in a MySQL database and allowed the user to perform CRUD operations on their data.

Let's now maintain all our data in the database.
We'll create an orders table and refactor our app to make use of it.

Goals
As a user I want to:
create a product, courier, or order and add it to a list
view all products, couriers, or orders
update the status of an order
persist my data
STRETCH delete or update a product, order, or courier
BONUS list orders by status or courier


Spec

A product should be a dict, i.e:
{  
   "id": 4,  
   "name": "Coke Zero",  
   "price": 0.8
}

A courier should be a dict, i.e:
{  
   "id": 2,  
   "name": "Bob",  
   "phone": "0789887889"
}

An order should be a dict, i.e:
{  
   "id": 1,  
   "customer_name": "John",  
   "customer_address": "Unit 2, 12 Main Street, LONDON, WH1 2ER",  
   "customer_phone": "0789887334",  
   "courier": 2, // Courier ID  
   "status": "preparing",  
   "items": [1, 3, 4] // Product IDs
}

SHOW LIST OF OPTIONS TO USER AND ACCEPT NUMERICAL INPUT

IF USER ENTERS 0 THEN EXIT APP

IF USER ENTERS 1 THEN SHOW PRODUCT MENU

  IF USER ENTERS 0 RETURN TO MAIN MENU
  
  IF USER ENTERS 1 SELECT ALL FROM PRODUCTS TABLE
  
  PRINT OUT PRODUCTS TO SCREEN
  
  IF USER ENTER 2 CREATE NEW PRODUCT
  
  ASK USER FOR THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT
  
  ASK USER FOR THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT
  
  INSERT INTO PRODUCTS TABLE
  
  STRETCH IF USER ENTERS 3 UPDATE PRODUCT
  
  ASK USER TO SELECT A PRODUCT TO UPDATE OR 0 TO CANCEL
  
  STRETCH IF USER ENTERS 4 DELETE PRODUCT
  
  ASK USER TO SELECT A PRODUCT TO DELETE OR 0 TO CANCEL
  
  DELETE ROW FROM PRODUCTS TABLE
  
IF USER ENTERS 2 THEN SHOW COURIER MENU

  IF USER ENTERS 0 RETURN TO MAIN MENU
  
  IF USER ENTERS 1 PRINT OUT COURIERS TO SCREEN
  
  IF USER ENTER 2 CREATE NEW COURIER
